#  #8 video was solutin for Ex-1 
# This video is based on typecasting in python

a="1"
b="4"
print(a+b)    # O/p = 14

# Using Explicit Typecasting

print(int(a)+int(b))

# Using Implicit Typecasting

c = 2.2            # Float type
d= 3               # int type

print(c+d)               # O/p = 5.2  ,it automatically gets converted into float type
