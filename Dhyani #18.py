# This video was based on While loops in python

i = int(input("Enter the number: "))
print(i)
while(i<=38):
  i = int(input("Enter the number: "))
  print(i)

print("Done with the loop")

# Another Example

# count = 5
# while (count > 0):
#   print(count)
#   count = count - 1
# else:
#   print("I am inside else")

# Do While Loop Conditions

# do {
  # loop body;
# }while(condition);
