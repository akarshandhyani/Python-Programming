# This video was about string slicing and operation on strings in python.

Car="Akarshan"
print(Car)

# To find length of the string
len1=len(Car)
print(len1)

#now slicing

print(Car[2:7])
print(Car[0:7])
print(Car[:7])
print(Car[2:])
print(Car[-5:-2])
print(Car[-2:-5])  # this doesn't gets printed as it becomes a ratio [6:3]
